EarthQuake Report App
===================================

This app displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world

This app uses a listview to display data of the recent earthquakes. The data is fetched online using a htttp request, so while using it internet connection is required. JSON data which is received, will be parsed and displayed in the listview using a custom adapter.
